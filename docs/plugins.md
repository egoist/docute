# Plugins

Plugins give you extra features without bloating docute itself.

## Search

### DocSearch

DocSearch is a free service from [algolia.com](http://algolia.com), it might be the easiest way to add search to your documentation.

To use this plugin, [apply for the program](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/) to get an API key and indexName first. 

Then simply load `docsearch.js` before all other scripts:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/docute/plugins/docsearch.js"></script>
<!-- put every other script behind -->
<script src="config.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/docute/dist/docute.js"></script>
```

Finally configure it in your config.js:

```js
self.$config = {
  // the docsearch variable is provided by docsearch plugin
  plugins: [
    docsearch({
      apiKey: 'You API Key',
      indexName: 'Your Index Name',
      // algolia docsearch allows you to search with tag filter
      tags: ['english', 'zh-Hans', 'zh-Hant']
    })
  ],
  // this plugin does require a url too
  // it should be the url of your website, without / at the end
  url: 'https://docute.js.org'
}
```

You can check out the [algolia docsearch config](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/master/configs/docute.json) for docute.js.org, we have `english` `zh-Hans` `zh-Hant` tags for now. By default the search bar in your doc will search all tags, but you may only allow it to search relevant tag for specified page. For example, search `english` tag on English page only.

Then use front-matter to do this:

```markdown
---
search: english
---
Now, search on this page will only give you results which is tagged by `english`
```

The `search` could also be an array so that it can search multiple tags:

```markdown
---
search: 
  - zh-Hans
  - zh-Hant
---
Easy?
```
