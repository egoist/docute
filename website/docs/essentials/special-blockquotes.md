To highlight some messages in your documentation, use the following format to write a `blockquote`:

```md
> __Alert__: This is a very dangerous action!
```

On GitHub it will be rendered as follows:

![2017-12-01 1 22 20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8784712/33468930-b835cb64-d69a-11e7-8ab2-25585d61915d.png)

And with Docute it renders:

> __Alert__: This is a very dangerous action!

We also support other message types which are:

```md
> __Info__: This is a info!

> __Warning__: This is a warning!

> __Success__: This is ok!

> __Note__: This is just a note!
```

And they look like:

> __Info__: This is a info!

<!-- -->

> __Warning__: This is a warning!

<!-- -->

> __Success__: This is ok!

<!-- -->

> __Note__: This is just a note!
