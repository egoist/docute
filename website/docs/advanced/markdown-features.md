## Messages

Colored message blocks, to emphasize part of your page. 

You can use the following format to write a `blockquote`:

```md
> __Alert__: This is a very dangerous action!
```

With Docute it will be rendered as follows:

> __Alert__: This is a very `dangerous`  action!

We also support other message types which are:

```md
> __Info__: This is a info!

> __Warning__: This is a warning!

> __Success__: This is ok!

> __Note__: This is just a note!
```

And they look like:

> __Info__: This is a info!

> __Warning__: This is a warning!

> __Success__: This is ok!

> __Note__: This is just a note!
